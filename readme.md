<h3>Requirements</h3>
    <p>This application was built as part of a group project to meet the graduation requirements of DigitalCrafts.</p>
    <h2>Front-end Guidelines</h2>
        <p>It must be responsive, with at least 3 clear breakpoints for mobile, tablet, and desktop. You may use any grid system (i.e. Bootstrap) you choose or you may write all the media queries yourself. You may borrow from them stylistically, but no pre- built templates. You are required to use a JS framework (React). Ensure that your front end is clean, easy to understand, and well engineered from a component perspective. You must use react-router in order to manage your applicationâ€™s navigation. And, you must use Axios for connections to APIs.</p>
    <h2>Back-end Guidelines</h2>
        <p>Backend must be in Python or Node.js. Express is not required, but a web framework is a good idea since you are likely making a web application. You may have a database if you desire, or you can choose a third party API to interact with. Third party storage APIs is not allowed (Firebase, etc).

Your backend must serve as an API for your front end. You should implement user authentication using the PassportJS node module. In addition to the basic requirements please choose one of the following additional features to implement:
            <ol>
                <li>Communication via web sockets (socket.io)</li>
                <li>Email communication from the server to a user</li>
                <li>Proxy another API call and transform the JSON</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

<h3>Facebook Terms of Service and Privacy Policy</h3> 
    <p> This is a school project. We are using Facebook in order to utilize Passport.js as a means to authenticate users. Nothing private is stored. We are only accessing your name and your profile id. </p>
